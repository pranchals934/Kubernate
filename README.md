what is kubernate ?
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Using the tutorials, you can learn to:

Deploy a containerized application on a cluster.
Scale the deployment.
Update the containerized application with a new software version.
Debug the containerized application.

What can Kubernetes do for you?
With modern web services, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and developers expect to deploy new versions of those applications several times a day. Containerization helps package software to serve these goals, enabling applications to be released and updated without downtime. Kubernetes helps you make sure those containerized applications run where and when you want, and helps them find the resources and tools they need to work. Kubernetes is a production-ready, open source platform designed with Google's accumulated experience in container orchestration, combined with best-of-breed ideas from the community.
